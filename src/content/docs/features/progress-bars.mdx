{/* ![Progress Bars for Primary]() */}

Primary offers styled Progress Bars out of the box, which you can use inside your notes.

This isn't a markdown feature so implementing it will be via using HTML tags.

Here's the code you can use to start:

```html
<progress  max="100" value="10"></progress>
```

- `progress` activates the progress bar element. Don't forget the closing tag `</progress>` â€” or else it won't show!
- `max` is the maximum value of the progress bar.
- `value` is the current value of the progress bar. If you set the value to 5, it will cover only 5% of the progress bar.

:::caution
Because Primary's progress bars change colors when you reach certain percentages, you can only use Primary's styled progress bars with `100` as your maximum value.

The progress bar will look as intended if used with any value from `0` to `100` with a maximum value of `100`. You will not get the theme's intended styling if say you put your maximum value as `10` and you use only values `0` to `10`.

## Customization

:::note[Is this feature customizable?]
Yes! With the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) plugin.

Customization for this feature is available from Primary 2.9.0 and above. Make sure to have Style Settings installed and turned on. Here are the steps to customize them:

<Steps>
1. In your Obsidian vault, open up Settings.
2. Under Community Plugins, click on **Style Settings**. Optionally, if you prefer to customize outside of the Settings modal, you can open up Style Settings through the Command Palette and looking for `Style Settings: Show style settings view`.
3. On the Style Settings tab, navigate to Primary Theme Settings -> Components -> Progress
4. Under Progress, you'll find the all customization options such as width, height, and colors.
