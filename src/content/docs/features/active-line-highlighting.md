![Active Line Highlighting in Primary](/src/media/demos/interface_active-line-highlighting.png)

:::caution
Editor Background Pattern is a feature available inside Primary only through the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
:::

If you need better visibility of which line you are at in your notes, you can toggle **Active Line Highlighting**.

Inside Primary Theme Settings, find this under `Interface` inside the `Editor` tab. It is called `Toggle Active Line Highlighting`.

This feature works with or without Line Numbers. If you'd like to toggle Line Numbers in your editor, simply open up **Settings**, and under the `Editor` tab, scroll down a bit and toggle on `Show line number`.
