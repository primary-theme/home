![Editor Background Pattern for Primary](../../../media/demos/interface_editor-bg.png)

:::caution
Editor Background Pattern is a feature available inside Primary only through the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
:::

By default, Primary provides you a plain cream color notebook-esque quality to the editor pane.

If you'd like, you can opt for a **line grid** or **dot grid** pattern background for your editor, just like notebooks!

You can turn this on inside Primary Theme Settings (via Style Settings plugin). Under `Interface`, go to the `Editor` tab.

Inside the `Editor` tab, choose your preferred *Background Type* (Plain Color, Line Grid, or Dot Grid).

You may also choose the size of the squares, as well as the pattern's color!
