:::caution
Colorful folders is a feature available inside Primary only through the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
:::

You can find this inside Style Settings under `Primary Theme Settings` â†’ `File Explorer`.

You can mix and match styling by toggling to color different elements of the folders: text, background, collapse indicators, and indentation guide.

Personally I like only coloring the collapse indicators and the indentation guide.

Color customization is available for each of the elements for up to 12 folders. By default you may notice the colors only cycle up to 6, but that's because I just set it up to repeat. Feel free to color it up to 12 as you wish.
