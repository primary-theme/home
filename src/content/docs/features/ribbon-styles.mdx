The **Ribbon** is the thin column at the left most part of your screen. Some folks that use a lot of plugins on a regular basis require this dock for easy access. Some folks never use it. While there is a setting natively in Obsidian to completely hide the ribbon, some folks still want the ability to access it occassionally but would rather not have it in sight when not in use.

So in Primary, besides being able to customize colors and borders, we added a preset that automatically hides/shows the ribbon on hover.

:::caution
Ribbon Styles is a feature available inside Primary only through the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) plugin.
:::

You can find this inside Style Settings under `Primary Theme Settings` → `Interface` → `Ribbon`.

Other customization options for the ribbon is available, including: border color adjustment, width adjustment, margin, background color, etc.
