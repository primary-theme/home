3. On the Style Settings tab, navigate to Primary Theme Settings -> Interface -> Editor.
4. Scroll down a bit and turn on `Toggle Active Line Highlighting`.
</Steps>

:::note[Is this feature customizable?]
Yes! With the [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) plugin. You can find the color customization option right below the toggle.
