Many of you have requested Karla's presence back in Primary, so here's how to do it.

<Steps>
1. Start by downloading [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla) via Google Fonts. Karla is a free font so no purchases needed. On the link, press `Get Font`, and a new page will show with Karla and 2 buttons. Press `Download All`. This will download a `.zip` file.
2. Once downloaded, extract the contents of the `.zip` file. You should have extracted a folder called `Karla`.
3. Go inside the `Karla` folder, and in it you should see something along the lines of `Karla-Italic-Variable...-wght.ttf` and `Karla-Variable...-wght.ttf `. These are font files. Install them.
   - If you're on **Windows**, select the two `.ttf` files, right click, and press `Install all`
   - If you're on **macOS**, open a `.ttf` file, and press the `Install` button. Do this for both `.ttf` files.
4. Once installed, go to your Obsidian Vault and open up **Settings**.
5. Go to **Appearance** tab and scroll down to the Font section. You should see *Interface Font*, *Text Font*, and *Monospace Font*. We're going to apply Karla as our Interface Font and our Text Font.
6. Under **Interface Font**, click `Manage`.
7. Under Font Name, find Karla. Once found, press `Add`, and click `Save`.
8. Do the same for **Text Font**. Under **Text Font**, click `Manage`. Find Karla, press `Add`, and click `Save`.
9. We're not finished yet though! You might notice that Karla is a bit thicker than usual. If you like it, you can stop here, but if not, keep reading to fix this.
10. Install [Style Settings](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-style-settings) via the Community Plugins.
11. Once installed, go back to the main page of Settings, and go to the **Style Settings** tab.
12. On the search bar of Style Settings, type `Font Weight`. This should produce results of settings that allow you to change global font weight settings.
13. Set the followings settings accordingly:
    - Thin Font Weight: from 150 → 100
    - Extralight Font Weight: from 250 → 200
    - Light Font Weight: from 350 → 300
    - Normal Font Weight: from 450 → 400
    - Medium Font Weight: from 550 → 500
    - Semibold Font Weight: from 650 → 600
    - Bold Font Weight: from 750 → 700
    - Extrabold Font Weight: from 850 → 800
    - Black Font Weight: from 900 → 900
    - Bold Modifier: keep at 200
14. Once you're done with the font weights, open up the **Command Palette**.
15. Find `Reload app without saving` and press `Enter`.
16. And you're done! You should be good to go.
