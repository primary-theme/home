Style Settings gives you complete access to Primary's styling variables. 

While presets were originally available in Primary v1.0 and embedded in the theme, I have decided to remove it in favor of manual setup. I want to squeeze out as much performance as possible while keeping Primary's aesthetics, hence the decision.

Presets will come out soon! This includes, Heading Style presets, markdown syntax presets, and more.
